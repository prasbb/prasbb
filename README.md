## 🔍 About Me

- 🧠 **ex-AI Intern @ Kongsberg Digital**  
   Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that improved asset data retrieval by **70%**, enabling faster decisions in oil, gas, and heavy-asset industries.

- 🧬 **Research Assistant @ Cellular Neuroscience Imaging Lab (UIUC)**  
   Built deep learning pipelines for **label-free segmentation** of SLIM microscopy images to support research on neurodegenerative disorders.

- 📚 **AI/ML Project Manager – CS 124 Honors**  
   Led the development of an image classification system using CNNs, mentored students through the ML pipeline, and documented CNN design principles.
